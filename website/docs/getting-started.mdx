## Installation

First you will need to install the library:

```

### Install Icon Font

To be able to use icons that come with this library, you will need to link the custom icon font file with your project as follows:

#### Bare Project

first, you will need to run

```bash
yarn react-native link
```

then re-build the native apps

```bash
# to re-build ios
yarn ios

# to re-build android
yarn android
```

#### Expo

first you need to install `expo-font`

```bash
expo install expo-font
```

then you will need to load the font at the root component

```tsx
const App = () => {
  ...
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    "baseui-icons": require("./node_modules/@gorhom/base-ui/fonts/baseui-icons.ttf"),
  });
  ...
  return loaded ? (
    // your app
  ) : null
}
```
